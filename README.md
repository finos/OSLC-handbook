# Open Source License Compliance Handbook

This handbook provides information on how to comply with some of the more common open source licenses under a specific set of use-cases. The goal here is to provide developers and engineers with some "self-serve" information to facilitate the end goal of open source license compliance, as well as identifying some of the more complex open source license compliance aspects for which consultation with open source counsel may be recommended.

Please review [DOCUMENTATION](DOCUMENTATION.adoc) before using this handbook.

# Acknowledgements
Huge thanks to Jilayne Lovejoy, who did the lion's share of the work on the to get the first version of the handbook out the door, and compiled the initial license compliance info. Aaron Williamson of FINOS conceived of the project, designed the YAML format for license info, and wrote the script to process the YAML into different outputs. 

Additional thanks Heather Meeker, Gary O'Neall, and Carlo Piana for reviewing the project before release and their invaluable feedback and contributions!
